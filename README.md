Breast Cancer -This project focuses on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
The final model is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports, and the PCA-transformed data is visualized for better interpretability. This approach ensures efficient, accurate, and robust tumor classification, helping in early diagnosis and decision-making. ðŸš€
